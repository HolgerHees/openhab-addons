## Python 3 Binding

This add-on provides support for Python 3 that can be used as a scripting language within automation rules.
It is based on [GraalPy](https://www.graalvm.org/python/) from the [GraalVM project](https://www.graalvm.org/).

Also included is [openhab-python](https://github.com/HolgerHees/openhab-python), a python library to support automation in openHAB. It provides convenient access to common core openHAB functions that make the full range of Java APIs easily accessible and usable
